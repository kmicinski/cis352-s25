Below, I provide an abbreviated syllabus with the major points--this website is not the official syllabus, the official syllabus will always be available at the above PDF.

##### Course Title: "Programming Languages: Theory and Practice"
(*CIS 352* at Syracuse U)

An introduction to the design and implementation of programming
languages, focused on operational semantics and interpreters. This
course is heavily project-focused, and a specific emphasis will be
placed upon training in algorithmic thinking and programming strategy.

<b>Instructors:</b>
- Kris Micinski, Asst. Prof at Syracuse ECS
  - Office hours 1hr before class on Tuesdays, 1hr after on Thursdays
  - **Office Location**: 4-185 CST Building, Center for Science and Technology
- Neda Abdolrahimi, teaching assistant
  - Office hours: Mondays, 9-12AM (during lab times).

**Workload**:
  - 4 individual (no collaboration, ChatGPT, etc...) projects (40%)
  - 4 group (up to 3, can use ChatGPT, etc...) programming exercises (10%)
  - Weekly (or more) attendance quizzes (5%)
  - Three homeworks (5%)
  - Exams (40%)
    - 2 midterms and 1 final, 20% each, lowest drops
  - This will be a *project-heavy* course. Approximately 3-5 hours per
    week outside of class is expected. I recommend against taking this
    course concurrent with other project-heavy courses.
