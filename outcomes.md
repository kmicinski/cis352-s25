<h2 class="obj">Written Learning Objectives for CIS352</h2>

The following learning objectives will be formally assessed via
written (or typed) exam throughout the term of CIS352. Each learning
objective will be turned into a written exam question which students
will have the opportunity to complete during quizzes / final.

The student must be able to...

<ol class="outcomes">
<li><a href="#lo1"></a>Identify expressions, forms, and callsites (in Racket).</li>

<li><a href="#lo2"></a>Implement traditional recursive algorithms in
direct style using numbers, lists, and conditionals.</li>

<li><a href="#lo3"></a>Differentiate tail calls (and tail
recursion) vs. direct-style calls; be able to implement tail-recursive
list accumulation algorithms.</li>

<li><a href="#lo4"></a>Draw cons diagrams for arbitrary
tree-shaped (Racket) data and (at a high level) explain its relation
to layout in RAM / cache.</li>

<li><a href="#lo5"></a>Use (and define) maps over lists and tree-shaped data.</li>

<li><a href="#lo6"></a>Use (and define) folds (such as foldl/foldr) to accumulate results of traversals over lists.</li>

<li><a href="#lo7"></a>Perform common (beta, alpha, eta) reductions /
conversions for the lambda calculus; evaluate lambda calculus terms
to normal form using various reduction strategies, including
call-by-name/value.</li>

<li><a href="#lo8"></a>Construct a metacircular interpreter for small, core languages (such as the lambda calculus)</li>

<li><a href="#lo9"></a>Perform Church encoding to translate
higher-level program constructs (variable-arity lambdas,
`let`-binding, recursion) to the lambda calculus. Specifically, be
able to use the U and Y combinators to implement recursion.</li>

<li><a href="lo10"></a>Construct correctly-formed proofs showing that a specific term in (a suitable extension of) the simply-typed lambda calculus has a particular type.</li>

<li><a href="lo11"></a>Explain the role of the root set as it pertains to mark-and-scan garbage collection.</li>

 </ol>
